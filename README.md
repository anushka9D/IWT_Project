<h1>Introduction 👇👇👇 </h1>

<p>Online Teacher Trainer is a website that helps teachers and lecturers to learn new skills 
and develop their knowledge about their subjects. This learning platform consists of many 
courses under several skill categories and learners can select any course depending on the skill 
they want to learn or improve. Courses are created by well educated and reputed lecturers who 
registered on the website.</p><br>

<p>Teachers and lecturers (learners) can visit the website on any device and see what 
courses are available, what are the topics included in those courses and the prices of those 
courses. To purchase and view the course content, learners first need to register on the website 
by clicking the “Register” button on the homepage and going to the registration page. After 
registration, learners can get a unique username and password. Then learners can login to the 
website at any time by using those credentials. When purchasing a course first learner needs to 
select a course from the courses page and click the “Buy” button on that course. Then that 
course will be added to the cart page and learners can pay for their selected courses using the 
“Pay Now” button on the cart page.  </p><br>

<p>If a registered or non-registered user needs any help when registering, selecting a 
course, making a payment or login to the website they can ask help from a support agent using 
the help & support page. If a registered user needs to change his/her password due to forgetting 
the password, that password reset part is also done by the support agent from this page. </p><br>

<p>When a lecturer needs to register on the website, they need to send an email to the 
administrator. By contacting and evaluating the lecturer, the administrator will add that lecturer 
via the admin dashboard. Lecturers have a separate page called “Lecturer Dashboard” and they 
can add courses, course topics, course content, course-related documents and videos from that 
dashboard. Lecturers can also send announcements through this dashboard.  </p><br>

<p>The administrator of the website has the power to manage all learners, lecturers and 
support agents by using the admin dashboard. Administrator also can send announcements 
through that dashboard. Any registered or non-registered user can view the about page, FAQ 
page, terms & conditions page and privacy policy page through the website. </p><br>
